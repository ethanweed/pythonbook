    "This is not highly surprising: the line that I've drawn in panel to the right doesn't \"fit\" the data very well, so it doesn't make a lot of sense to propose it as a way of summarising the data, right? This is a very simple observation to make, but it turns out to be very powerful when we start trying to wrap just a little bit of maths around it. To do so, let's start with a refresher of some high school maths. The formula for a straight line is usually written like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "y = mx + c\n",
    "$$ \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Or, at least, that's what it was when I went to high school all those years ago.[^americanhighschool] The two *variables* are $x$ and $y$, and we have two *coefficients*, $m$ and $c$. The coefficient $m$ represents the *slope* of the line, and the coefficient $c$ represents the *$y$-intercept* of the line. Digging further back into our decaying memories of high school (sorry, for some of us high school was a long time ago), we remember that the intercept is interpreted as \"the value of $y$ that you get when $x=0$\". Similarly, a slope of $m$ means that if you increase the $x$-value by 1 unit, then the $y$-value goes up by $m$ units; a negative slope means that the $y$-value would go down rather than up. Ah yes, it's all coming back to me now. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we've remembered that, it should come as no surprise to discover that we use the exact same formula to describe a regression line. If $Y$ is the outcome variable (the DV) and $X$ is the predictor variable (the IV), then the formula that describes our regression is written like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\hat{Y_i} = b_1 X_i + b_0\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Hm. Looks like the same formula, but there's some extra frilly bits in this version. Let's make sure we understand them. Firstly, notice that I've written $X_i$ and $Y_i$ rather than just plain old $X$ and $Y$. This is because we want to remember that we're dealing with actual data. In this equation, $X_i$ is the value of predictor variable for the $i$th observation (i.e., the number of hours of sleep that I got on day $i$ of my little study), and $Y_i$ is the corresponding value of the outcome variable (i.e., my grumpiness on that day). And although I haven't said so explicitly in the equation, what we're assuming is that this formula works for all observations in the data set (i.e., for all $i$). Secondly, notice that I wrote $\\hat{Y}_i$ and not $Y_i$. This is because we want to make the distinction between the *actual data* $Y_i$, and the *estimate* $\\hat{Y}_i$ (i.e., the prediction that our regression line is making). Thirdly, I changed the letters used to describe the coefficients from $m$ and $c$ to $b_1$ and $b_0$. That's just the way that statisticians like to refer to the coefficients in a regression model. I've no idea why they chose $b$, but that's what they did. In any case $b_0$ always refers to the intercept term, and $b_1$ refers to the slope.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Excellent, excellent. Next, I can't help but notice that -- regardless of whether we're talking about the good regression line or the bad one -- the data don't fall perfectly on the line. Or, to say it another way, the data $Y_i$ are not identical to the predictions of the regression model $\\hat{Y_i}$. Since statisticians love to attach letters, names and numbers to everything, let's refer to the difference between the model prediction and that actual data point as a *residual*, and we'll refer to it as $\\epsilon_i$.[^noteepsilon] Written using mathematics, the residuals are defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\epsilon_i = Y_i - \\hat{Y}_i\n",
    "$$\n",

    "$$\n",
    "Y_i = b_1 X_i + b_0 + \\epsilon_i\n",
    "$$\n",

[1990](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1990) [CE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Era)  we learned this as $y=ax+b$. Why? Who decides whether it is $a$ or $m$? $c$ or $b$? I truly have no idea, but either way, it represents the same idea."

    "Okay, now let's redraw our pictures, but this time I'll add some lines to show the size of the residual for all observations. When the regression line is good, our residuals (the lengths of the solid black lines) all look pretty small, as shown in the left panel of {numref}`fig-sleep_regressions_2`, but when the regression line is a bad one, the residuals are a lot larger, as you can see from looking at the right panel of {numref}`fig-sleep_regressions_2`. Hm. Maybe what we \"want\" in a regression model is *small* residuals. Yes, that does seem to make sense. In fact, I think I'll go so far as to say that the \"best fitting\" regression line is the one that has the smallest residuals. Or, better yet, since statisticians seem to like to take squares of everything why not say that ...\n",
    "\n",
    "> The estimated regression coefficients, $\\hat{b}_0$ and $\\hat{b}_1$ are those that minimise the sum of the squared residuals, which we could either write as $\\sum_i (Y_i - \\hat{Y}_i)^2$ or as $\\sum_i {\\epsilon_i}^2$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, yes that sounds even better. And since I've indented it like that, it probably means that this is the right answer. And since this is the right answer, it's probably worth making a note of the fact that our regression coefficients are *estimates* (we're trying to guess the parameters that describe a population!), which is why I've added the little hats, so that we get $\\hat{b}_0$ and $\\hat{b}_1$ rather than $b_0$ and $b_1$. Finally, I should also note that -- since there's actually more than one way to estimate a regression model -- the more technical name for this estimation process is **_ordinary least squares (OLS) regression_**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "At this point, we now have a concrete definition for what counts as our \"best\" choice of regression coefficients, $\\hat{b}_0$ and $\\hat{b}_1$. The natural question to ask next is,  if our optimal regression coefficients are those that minimise the sum squared residuals, how do we *find* these wonderful numbers? The actual answer to this question is complicated, and it doesn't help you understand the logic of regression.[^notekungfu] As a result, this time I'm going to let you off the hook. Instead of showing you how to do it the long and tedious way first, and then \"revealing\" the wonderful shortcut that Python provides you with, let's cut straight to the chase... and use Python to do all the heavy lifting. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "[^notekungfu]: Or at least, I'm assuming that it doesn't help most people. But on the off chance that someone reading this is a proper kung fu master of linear algebra (and to be fair, I always have a few of these people in my intro stats class), it *will* help *you* to know that the solution to the estimation problem turns out to be $\\hat{b} = (X^TX)^{-1} X^T y$, where $\\hat{b}$ is a vector containing the estimated regression coefficients,  $X$ is the \"design matrix\" that contains the predictor variables (plus an additional column containing all ones; strictly $X$ is a matrix of the regressors, but I haven't discussed the distinction yet), and $y$ is a vector containing the outcome variable. For everyone else, this isn't exactly helpful, and can be downright scary. However, since quite a few things in linear regression can be written in linear algebra terms, you'll see a bunch of footnotes like this one in this chapter. If you can follow the maths in them, great. If not, ignore it."

    "As always, there are several different ways we could go about calculating a linear regression in Python, but we'll stick with `pingouin`[^drink], which for my money is one of the simplest and easiest packages to use. The `pingouin` command for linear regression is, well, `linear_regression`, so that couldn't be much more straightforward. After that, we just need to tell `pinguoin` which variable we want to use as a predictor variable (independent variable), and which one we want to use as the outcome variable (dependent variable). `pingouin` wants the predictor variable first, so, since we want to model my grumpiness as a function of my sleep, we write:\n",

If we remember the definition of the slope, a regression coefficient of $\\hat{b}_1 = -8.94$ means that if I increase $X_i$ by 1, then I'm decreasing $Y_i$ by 8.94. That is, each additional hour of sleep that I gain will improve my mood, reducing my grumpiness by 8.94 grumpiness points. What about the intercept? Well, since $\\hat{b}_0$ corresponds to \"the expected value of $Y_i$ when $X_i$ equals 0\", it's pretty straightforward. It implies that if I get zero hours of sleep ($X_i =0$) then my grumpiness will go off the scale, to an insane value of ($Y_i = 125.96$). Best to be avoided, I think.\n"

    "One final thing to point out before moving on. It's quite common for people to report a slightly different measure of model performance, known as \"adjusted $R^2$\". The motivation behind calculating the adjusted $R^2$ value is the observation that adding more predictors into the model will *always* cause the $R^2$ value to increase (or at least not decrease). The adjusted $R^2$ value introduces a slight change to the calculation, as follows. For a regression model with $K$ predictors, fit to a data set containing $N$ observations, the adjusted $R^2$ is:\n",

    "This adjustment is an attempt to take the degrees of freedom into account. The big advantage of the adjusted $R^2$ value is that when you add more predictors to the model, the adjusted $R^2$ value will only increase if the new variables improve the model performance more than you'd expect by chance. The big disadvantage is that the adjusted $R^2$ value *can't* be interpreted in the elegant way that $R^2$ can. $R^2$ has a simple interpretation as the proportion of variance in the outcome variable that is explained by the regression model; to my knowledge, no equivalent interpretation exists for adjusted $R^2$. \n",
    "\n",
    "An obvious question then, is whether you should report $R^2$ or adjusted $R^2$. This is probably a matter of personal preference. If you care more about interpretability, then $R^2$ is better. If you care more about correcting for bias, then adjusted $R^2$ is probably better. Speaking just for myself, I prefer $R^2$: my feeling is that it's more important to be able to interpret your measure of model performance. Besides, as we'll soon see in the upcoming section on hypothesis tests for regression models, which I am going to link to even though it is [literally the next section in this book](regressiontests), if you're worried that the improvement in $R^2$ that you get by adding a predictor is just due to chance and not because it's a better model, well, we've got hypothesis tests for that.

In this case, the model performs significantly better than you'd expect by chance ($F(2,97) = 215.2$, $p<.001$), which isn't all that surprising: the $R^2 = .812$ value indicate that the regression model accounts for 81.2\\% of the variability in the outcome measure. However, when we look back up at the $t$-tests for each of the individual coefficients, we have pretty strong evidence that the `baby_sleep` variable has no significant effect; all the work is being done by the `dan_sleep` variable. Taken together, these results suggest that `mod2` is actually the wrong model for the data: you'd probably be better off dropping the `baby_sleep` predictor entirely. In other words, the `mod1` model that we started with is the better model. "

But we aren't restricted to computing a single correlation: you can compute *all* pairwise correlations among the variables in your data set. This leads people to the natural question: can we also run hypothesis tests on all of the pairwise correlations in our data using `pg.corr`?\n",

Testing a single correlation is fine: if you've got some reason to be asking \"is A related to B?\", then you should absolutely run a test to see if there's a significant correlation. But if you've got variables A, B, C, D and E and you're thinking about testing the correlations among all possible pairs of these, a statistician would want to ask: what's your hypothesis? If you're in the position of wanting to test all possible pairs of variables, then you're pretty clearly on a fishing expedition, hunting around in search of significant effects when you don't actually have a clear research hypothesis in mind. This is *dangerous*, and perhaps the authors of the `corr` function didn't want to endorse this sort of behavior. `corr` does have the nice feature that you can call it as an attribute of your dataframe, so for our parenthood data, if we want to see all the parwise correlations in the data, you can simply write"

From this perspective, it's okay to run hypothesis tests on all your pairwise correlations, but you must treat them as post hoc analyses, and if so you need to apply a correction for multiple comparisons. `rcorr`, also from `pingouin`, lets you do this.

    "### Calculating standardised regression coefficients\n",
    "\n",
    "One more thing that you might want to do is to calculate \"standardised\" regression coefficients, often denoted $\\beta$. The rationale behind standardised coefficients goes like this. In a lot of situations, your variables are on fundamentally different scales. Suppose, for example, my regression model aims to predict people's IQ scores, using their educational attainment (number of years of education) and their income as predictors. Obviously, educational attainment and income are not on the same scales: the number of years of schooling can only vary by 10s of years, whereas income would vary by 10,000s of dollars (or more). The units of measurement have a big influence on the regression coefficients: the $b$ coefficients only make sense when interpreted in light of the units, both of the predictor variables and the outcome variable. This makes it very difficult to compare the coefficients of different predictors. Yet there are situations where you really do want to make comparisons between different coefficients. Specifically, you might want some kind of standard measure of which predictors have the strongest relationship to the outcome. This is what **_standardised coefficients_** aim to do. "

    "The basic idea is quite simple: the standardised coefficients are the coefficients that you would have obtained if you'd converted all the variables to [standard scores](zscores) $z$-scores before running the regression.[^noteregressors]  The idea here is that, by converting all the predictors to $z$-scores, they all go into the regression on the same scale, thereby removing the problem of having variables on different scales. Regardless of what the original variables were, a $\\beta$ value of 1 means that an increase in the predictor of 1 standard deviation will produce a corresponding 1 standard deviation increase in the outcome variable. Therefore, if variable A has a larger absolute value of $\\beta$ than variable B, it is deemed to have a stronger relationship with the outcome. Or at least that's the idea: it's worth being a little cautious here, since this does rely very heavily on the assumption that \"a 1 standard deviation change\" is fundamentally the same kind of thing for all variables. It's not always obvious that this is true. \n",
    "\n",
    "[^noteregressors]: Strictly, you standardise all the *regressors*: that is, every \"thing\" that has a regression coefficient associated with it in the model. For the regression models that I've talked about so far, each predictor variable maps onto exactly one regressor, and vice versa. However, that's not actually true in general: we'll see some examples of this when we learn about [factorial ANOVA](anova2). But for now, we don't need to care too much about this distinction."

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Normality*. Like half the models in statistics, standard linear regression relies on an assumption of normality. Specifically, it assumes that the *residuals* are normally distributed. It's actually okay if the predictors $X$ and the outcome $Y$ are non-normal, so long as the residuals $\\epsilon$ are normal. See [](regressionnormality).\n",
    "- *Linearity*. A pretty fundamental assumption of the linear regression model is that relationship between $X$ and $Y$ actually be linear! Regardless of whether it's a simple regression or a multiple regression, we assume that the relatiships involved are linear. See [](regressionlinearity).\n",
    "- *Homogeneity of variance*. Strictly speaking, the regression model assumes that each residual $\\epsilon_i$ is generated from a normal distribution with mean 0, and (more importantly for the current purposes) with a standard deviation $\\sigma$ that is the same for every single residual. In practice, it's impossible to test the assumption that every residual is identically distributed. Instead, what we care about is that the standard deviation of the residual is the same for all values of $\\hat{Y}$, and (if we're being especially paranoid) all values of every predictor $X$ in the model. See [](regressionhomogeneity).\n",
    "- *Uncorrelated predictors*. The idea here is that, is a multiple regression model, you don't want your predictors to be too strongly correlated with each other. This isn't  \"technically\" an assumption of the regression model, but in practice it's required. Predictors that are too strongly correlated with each other (referred to as \"collinearity\") can cause problems when evaluating the model. See [](regressioncollinearity)\n",
    "- *Residuals are independent of each other*. This is really just a \"catch all\" assumption, to the effect that \"there's nothing else funny going on in the residuals\". If there is something weird (e.g., the residuals all depend heavily on some other unmeasured variable) going on, it might screw things up.\n",
    "- *No \"bad\" outliers*. Again, not actually a technical assumption of the model (or rather, it's sort of implied by all the others), but there is an implicit assumption that your regression model isn't being too strongly influenced by one or two anomalous data points; since this raises questions about the adequacy of the model, and the trustworthiness of the data in some cases.

I refer to this as the \"art\" of model checking with good reason: it's not easy, and while there are a lot of fairly standardised tools that you can use to diagnose and maybe even cure the problems that ail your model (if there are any, that is!), you really do need to exercise a certain amount of judgment when doing this. It's easy to get lost in all the details of checking this thing or that thing, and it's quite exhausting to try to remember what all the different things are. This has the very nasty side effect that a lot of people get frustrated when trying to learn *all* the tools, so instead they decide not to do *any* model checking. This is a bit of a worry! \n",

In particular, the following three kinds of residual are referred to in this section: \"ordinary residuals\", \"standardised residuals\", and \"Studentised residuals\". There is a fourth kind that you'll see referred to in some of the figures, and that's the \"Pearson residual\": however, for the models that we're talking about in this chapter, the Pearson residual is identical to the ordinary residual. \n",

I've been using the notation $\\epsilon_i$ to refer to the $i$-th ordinary residual, and by gum I'm going to stick to it. With this in mind, we have the very simple equation\n",

    "One danger that you can run into with linear regression models is that your analysis might be disproportionately sensitive to a smallish number of \"unusual\" or \"anomalous\" observations. In the context of linear regression, there are three conceptually distinct ways in which an observation might be called \"anomalous\". All three are interesting, but they have rather different implications for your analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first kind of unusual observation is an **_outlier_**. The definition of an outlier (in this context) is an observation that is very different from what the regression model predicts. An example is shown in {numref}`fig-outlier`. In practice, we operationalise this concept by saying that an outlier is an observation that has a very large Studentised residual, $\\epsilon_i^*$. Outliers are interesting: a big outlier *might* correspond to junk data -- e.g., the variables might have been entered incorrectly, or some other defect may be detectable. Note that you shouldn't throw an observation away just because it's an outlier. But the fact that it's an outlier is often a cue to look more closely at that case, and try to find out why it's so different."

    "The second way in which an observation can be unusual is if it has high **_leverage_**: this happens when the observation is very different from all the other observations. This doesn't necessarily have to correspond to a large residual: if the observation happens to be unusual on all variables in precisely the same way, it can actually lie very close to the regression line. An example of this is shown in panel A of {numref}`fig-leverage-influence`. The leverage of an observation is operationalised in terms of its *hat value*, usually written $h_i$. The formula for the hat value is rather complicated[^notehatmatrix] but its interpretation is not: $h_i$ is a measure of the extent to which the $i$-th observation is \"in control\" of where the regression line ends up going. We won't bother extracting the hat values here, but if you want to do this, you can use the `get_influence` method from the `statsmodels.api` package to inspect the relative influence of data points. For now, it is enough to get an intuitive, visual idea of what leverage can mean.\n",

The name comes from the fact that this is the matrix that \"puts a hat on $y$\". The  hat *value* of the $i$-th observation is the $i$-th diagonal element of this matrix (so technically I should be writing it as $h_{ii}$ rather than $h_{i}$). Oh, and in case you care, here's how it's calculated: $H = X(X^TX)^{-1} X^T$. Pretty, isn't it?"

    "An obvious question to ask next is, if you do have large values of Cook's distance, what should you do? As always, there's no hard and fast rules. Probably the first thing to do is to try running the regression with that point excluded and see what happens to the model performance and to the regression coefficients. If they really are substantially different, it's time to start digging into your data set and your notes that you no doubt were scribbling as your ran your study; try to figure out *why* the point is so different. If you start to become convinced that this one data point is badly distorting your results, you might consider excluding it, but that's less than ideal unless you have a solid explanation for why this particular case is qualitatively different from the others and therefore deserves to be handled separately.[^noterobust] To give an example, let's delete the observation from day 64, the observation with the largest Cook's distance for the `mod2` model, where we predicted my grumpiness on the basis of my sleep, and my baby's sleep.\n",

    "If our residuals were _perfectly_ normally distributed, then they would lie right on the red line. These residuals veer off a little at the ends, but again, pretty damn close, so the Q-Q plot further confirms our conviction based on the histogram and the Shapiro-Wilk test, that it is appropriate to model these data with a linear regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "A little note: Q-Q plots are often created by plotting the quantiles of the _standardized_ residuals against the theoretical quantiles. Since using Q-Q plots for assessing normality is basically a matter of squinting at the plot at getting a _feeling_, based on your great experience of squinting at plots, for whether the data _seem_ normal enough, it probably doesn't matter so much which way you do it. Below you can see a side-by-side comparison of a Q-Q plot of the ordinary (left) and standardized (right) residuals. Honestly, they look about the same to me, and you can get the ordinary residuals straight from `pingouin`, without needing to invoke `statsmodels`."
