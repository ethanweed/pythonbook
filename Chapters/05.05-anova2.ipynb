    "Over the course of the last few chapters you can probably detect a general trend. We started out looking at tools that you can use to compare two groups to one another, most notably the [$t$-test](ttest). Then, we introduced [analysis of variance](anova) (ANOVA) as a method for comparing more than two groups. The chapter on [regression](regression) covered a somewhat different topic, but in doing so it introduced a powerful new idea: building statistical models that have *multiple* predictor variables used to explain a single outcome variable. For instance, a regression model could be used to predict the number of errors a student makes in a reading comprehension test based on the number of hours they studied for the test, and their score on a standardised IQ test. The goal in this chapter is to import this idea into the ANOVA framework. For instance, suppose we were interested in using the reading comprehension test to measure student achievements in three different schools, and we suspect that girls and boys are developing at different rates (and so would be expected to have different performance on average). Each student is classified in two different ways: on the basis of their gender, and on the basis of their school. What we'd like to do is analyse the reading comprehension scores in terms of *both* of these grouping variables. The tool for doing so is generically referred to as **_factorial ANOVA_**. However, since we have two grouping variables, we sometimes refer to the analysis as a two-way ANOVA, in contrast to the one-way ANOVAs that we [ran earlier](anova)."

    "When we discussed [analysis of variance](anova), we assumed a fairly simple experimental design: each person falls into one of several groups, and we want to know whether these groups have different means on some outcome variable. In this section, I'll discuss a broader class of experimental designs, known as **_factorial designs_**, in we have more than one grouping variable. I gave one example of how this kind of design might arise above. Another example appears in the chapter on [ANOVA](anova), in which we were looking at the effect of different drugs on the `mood_gain` experienced by each person. In that chapter we did find a significant effect of drug, but at the end of the chapter we also ran an analysis to see if there was an effect of therapy. We didn't find one, but there's something a bit worrying about trying to run two *separate* analyses trying to predict the same outcome. Maybe there actually *is* an effect of therapy on mood gain, but we couldn't find it because it was being \"hidden\" by the effect of drug? In other words, we're going to want to run a *single* analysis that includes *both* `drug` and `therapy` as predictors. For this analysis each person is cross-classified by the drug they were given (a factor with 3 levels) and what therapy they received (a factor with 2 levels). We refer to this as a $3 \\times 2$ factorial design. If we cross-tabulate `drug` by `therapy` using the `crosstab()` in `pandas`, we get the following table:"

    "Like one-way ANOVA, factorial ANOVA is a tool for testing certain types of hypotheses about population means. So a sensible place to start would be to be explicit about what our hypotheses actually are. However, before we can even get to that point, it's really useful to have some clean and simple notation to describe the population means. Because of the fact that observations are cross-classified in terms of two different factors, there are quite a lot of different means that one might be interested. To see this, let's start by thinking about all the different sample means that we can calculate for this kind of design. Firstly, there's the obvious idea that we might be interested in this table of group means:"

For instance, how should we describe the average mood gain across the entire (hypothetical) population of people who might be given Joyzepam in an experiment like this, regardless of whether they were in CBT? We use the \"dot\" notation to express this. In the case of Joyzepam, notice that we're talking about the mean associated with the third row in the table. That is, we're averaging across two cell means (i.e., $\\mu_{31}$ and $\\mu_{32}$). The result of this averaging is referred to as a **_marginal mean_**, and would be denoted $\\mu_{3.}$ in this case. The marginal mean for CBT corresponds to the population mean associated with the second column in the table, so we use the notation $\\mu_{.2}$ to describe it.

We'll discuss unbalanced designs later, and when we do so you'll see that all of our calculations become a real headache. But let's ignore this for now."

    "Now that we have this notation, it is straightforward to formulate and express some hypotheses. Let's suppose that the goal is to find out two things: firstly, does the choice of drug have any effect on mood, and secondly, does CBT have any effect on mood? These aren't the only hypotheses that we could formulate of course, and we'll see a really important example of a different kind of hypothesis in the section on [interactions](interactions), but these are the two simplest hypotheses to test, and so we'll start there. Consider the first test. If drug has no effect, then we would expect all of the row means to be identical, right? So that's our null hypothesis. On the other hand, if the drug does matter then we should expect these row means to be different. Formally, we write down our null and alternative hypotheses in terms of the *equality of marginal means*:"

To see this, let's not worry about how the sums of squares values are calculated: instead, let's take it on faith that Python has calculated the SS values correctly, and try to verify that all the rest of the numbers make sense. First, note that for the `drug` factor, we divide $3.45$ by $2$, and end up with a mean square value of $1.73$. For the `therapy` factor, there's only 1 degree of freedom, so our calculations are even simpler: dividing $0.47$ (the SS value) by 1 gives us an answer of $0.47$ (the MS value). \n",

The corresponding calculation for the `therapy` variable would be to divide $0.47$ by $0.07$ which gives $7.08$ as the $F$-statistic.

Once again, there is nothing new here: for each of our two factors, what we're trying to do is test the null hypothesis that there is no relationship between the factor and the outcome variable (I'll be a bit more precise about this later on). To that end, we've (apparently) followed a similar strategy that we did in the one way ANOVA, and have calculated an $F$-statistic for each of these hypotheses. To convert these to $p$ values, all we need to do is note that the  that the sampling distribution for the $F$ *statistic* under the null hypothesis (that the factor in question is irrelevant) is an $F$ *distribution*: and that two degrees of freedom values are those corresponding to the factor, and those corresponding to the residuals. For the `drug` factor we're talking about an $F$ distribution with 2 and 14 degrees of freedom (I'll discuss degrees of freedom in more detail later). In contrast, for the `therapy` factor sampling distribution is $F$ with 1 and 14 degrees of freedom."
